# ðŸŒ¿ e_limo: Remote Irrigation Management System ðŸŒ¿
# Overview
e_limo is an innovative remote irrigation management system designed to help farmers monitor and control irrigation activities without physically being on the farm. The system uses pre-determined optimum values (based on crop type, location, planting date, and altitude) to automatically decide whether to start or stop irrigation. The system can be accessed via a user-friendly web interface and supports Bluetooth or Wi-Fi connectivity to irrigation devices.

# Key Features
Remote Control: Start or stop irrigation from anywhere via the web.
Automated Decision-Making: Determines irrigation needs based on real-time sensor data and optimum values.
Crop Management: Configure irrigation parameters based on crop type and environmental factors.
Data Visualization: Monitor moisture levels, temperature, and irrigation history through interactive dashboards.
Device Connectivity: Supports Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connections to irrigation devices.
Secure Access: User authentication for secure system access.
Reports and Analytics: Generate and export reports on irrigation activities.
